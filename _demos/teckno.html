  <p><span class="blink" style="color: #00ff80; font-size: 4em; font-weight: bold;">Yo!</span> <strong>Dame VL</strong> here in da house, and herez are
    oldie for yas! Nope, it's not<em> "New Labour, new demo"</em> time yet! This is a demo from the old demo crew me and
    <strong>Jackson Pollock</strong> were in. I say demo crew, I mean <strong><span class="blink">PRATS</span></strong>!
    Apart from us 2 kool dudes of course. The crew were called "<strong>SPEAKEASY 7</strong>"- you've probably never
    heard of them, but that's no surprise because they were <strong><span class="blink">CRAP</span></strong>! The only
    good thing going for these losers was:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>the name, which I thought up</li>
    <li>myself and Jackson Pollock. My handle was "<strong>Octave-8</strong>" (Cool, huh?) and JP was called
      "<strong>Motorcycle Emptiness</strong>" after a song by the <strong>Manic Street Whatisnames</strong>. (Before
      they lost that thin dude. In fact, it was before that <strong>Kurt</strong> and his shotgun sandwich!)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We had the idea of doing a music demo in 1992- I was told to do some killa musix, and JP to do da visual FX. I went
    away and came up with the goodz- a pumping techno soundtrack (This is 1992, so it sounds a bit more laid-back
    now!!!) and JP came back with the graficks! As soon as I told the rest of the crew about my new piece of zax, they
    went <em>"Oh no!"</em> because JP had just phoned to tell them that he had decided that the demo was to be an
    <strong>anti-techno</strong> music demo, and had come up with anti-techno situationist sloganz logoze! We were told
    to fix the problemo pronto, or receive the order of the boot!</p>
  <p>I contacted JP, who wasn't best pleased, and said<em> "No, hang on, that's cool!"</em> and suggested that whatever
    those losers in the crew might think, we'll try to accomodate both viewz in the demo! (I'm always open-minded
    towards other views even if they are a load of complete shit!) So we worked for a couple days on the demo, then
    showed it off to the rest of the guyz! <em>"Hey presto, dudes, the new <strong>Speakeasy 7</strong> demo!!"</em></p>
  <p>It was well kool! Anti-techno slogans flashing in time with my <strong>dance floor killa kut</strong>! It was the
    first time any of them had seen JPs GFX for the demo, and the first time they had heard my mega chip-muzak techno
    module. <em>(The first techno module ever in <strong>ST chip musix</strong>!) </em>The impact must have been <strong
      class="blink" style="font-size:larger;">MEGA!</strong></p>
  <p>Well, that's what I thought, but the other guys took one look at it, and told us to fuck off! I decided I was too
    big for the group, and left, and JP did likewise. Last I heard of those losers, they're employed in some database
    company or something with no demo releases to their name, while we joined an internationally reknowed demo crew
    whose web pages are mentioned in <strong><a href="../features/presstrail/ac2.html">famous Atari
        magazines</a></strong>. <em>C'est la vie</em> as Robbie Williams says...</p>
