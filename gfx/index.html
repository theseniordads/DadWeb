<p>Howdee-doody my friends- if you've ever wondered who is responsible for all the visual splendour of this web site and
    the Senior Dads <a href="../assets/images/demos/index.html">demos</a>, then look no further. Welcome to my own private
    gallery! <strong><em>(Cue spooky "Gallery" music from "Vision on".)</em></strong> Feel free to look around, but
    please remember to take all you litter home with you!</p>
<p>I joined the crew as they were planning to launch their website. They were sorely needing a new artistic direction
    for their beacon in Cyberspace, so, having heard I was an "arty" type of person, Doddering Git asked me to join the
    crew over a pint of snakebite at the Rolf Harris bar at the student union. I gave the website a new graphical design
    angle, based around a specially designed <strong><a class="gallery-JP" title="My iconic Senior Dads logo!"
            href="../assets/images/sad_logo.gif">Senior Dads logo</a></strong>. The guys were so impressed, they asked me to
    join their crew as an official member! ... And the rest is history... <strong><em>(Cue epic historical type
            music.)</em></strong></p>
<p>Do you like this background BTW? I'm now learning how to use <strong>Photoshop</strong>, so expect to see further
    examples of this cropping up in future demos!!</p>
