On the day one of my letters appears in Melody Maker...

Isn't that "Tic Tac" ad a bit "tic" tacky??!?!

Not-so-cool bloke:  Anyone for mints!?!?
Loads of models:    Nooo!!!!
Cool-looking woman: Anyone for Tic-Tacs!?!?
Loads of models:    Yeah!!!!
<Loads of models strut down catwalk!!!>

Bit obvious if you ask me!!!! What if it went like this:

Not-so-cool bloke:  Anyone for fresh dog-doo!?!?
Loads of models:    Nooo!!!!
Cool-looking woman: Anyone for dog-doo flavoured Tic-Tacs!?!?
Loads of models:    Yeah!!!!
<Loads of models strut down catwalk and are sick on the
 spectators!!!>

It would be a bit stupid, wouldn't it?!?!?! So sort it,
Tic Tac ad people!!!!

Old Fart!
