          you.... You get a lollipop, right, and you stick in this "holder" thingy, 
          which contains recordings of various sound efffects... And the holder 
          takes the sound data, and vibrates the lolly, so that you get all the 
          sounds in your head!!!!!!! Well, a lot of people seem to like the idea 
          anyway!!!! If you're a regular reader, (See <a href="6.html#174"> issue

          a lot of people with Linux boxes have made them out of the old out-of-date 
          parts that can't run the lastest software on their current Wintel PCs!!! 
          Well, someone's taken it to another level by linking a whole lot of 
          them together in a "Beowulf" network!!!! What *that* is I do not know, 
          but it's supposed to be big anyway, so it's impressive that they can 
          do it with old bits of computers!!!

flippin' thing can work at all, never mind racing along '100 times faster than a
top-end workstation'!!!! Well, they're using loads of spiffy software as diagnostic
tools to correct the errors in the broken parts!!! They're actually seriously
going for a trillion instructions per second on this thing!!! So, it might be
rubbish, but it's very fast rubbish!!!!

been keeping my ear on the ground to hear what's new in MPEG-land!!!
(Well, obviously I've not literally got my ear on the ground, as that
would be really silly wouldn't it!!!! No, I'm actually reading web
pages about it actually!!!!)
<P>
Anyway, I was recently in a sort of
"argument" with someone on <a href="news://alt.digitiser/">news://alt.digitiser/</a> about General MIDI
versus soundtracker modules for music. This guy argued (pretty reasonably)
that GM was portable between machines and sounded good on a proper MIDI
setup, whilst I argued that you didn't have that much control over how
GM sounds on a machine but on soundtracker mods you have complete control
within the (comparatively limited) format, and they sound the same
on all the machines. The only problem was there there are a lot of
different soundtracker formats and they vary from platform to platform!!!!
So what we really would need is a format that has the portability of GM,
but allows the complete control of sound that you can get with
soundtracker mods!!!!!
<P>
Sounds a tall order, well say hello to <STRONG>MP4</STRONG>!!! It's pencilled
in for proper "launch" later this year, but the specs are online, and audio-wise
it looks like the ultimate format that soundtracker fans have been looking for!!!
Don't confuse this with MP3 tho- it's as different as Cubase is to an old 8-track
cartridge!!! You can play bits of sampled sound like in MP3, but you can also play
"instruments" in a MIDI stylee, and add effects to them like reverb and so on...
What's really interesting is that they're not just instruments of the sampled
type- they can be "synthesised", and we're not talking about cheapo sounding
synths here, we're talking about all the latest techniques used in the new keyboards
like: vector synthesis, physical modelling, emulation of analogue and so on!!!
Obviously the drawbacks here are that you'd need a bloody good processor to to do
all this sort of stuff!!! The other prob I can see is that tracker progs using MP4
would almost be as complex as MIDI progs, with loadsa special plugin progs to fully
use the synthy bits!!! (eg 303 emulators, anyone?!?!)
<P>
I've only just talked about the audio stuff, but the video bit of MP4 looks almost
as good!!! Apparently you can make "synthetic people" to talk along with dialog, and
plonk people in front of backgrounds and so on... Looks like a format you can make
wacky video and audio with!!!! It'll probably kill your Pentium tho!!!!!

things happen randomly in quantum physics which is a little different really!!!!

heard of <B>The Gimp</B>!!!! Nope, it's not a mysterious leather-clad Linux and S&M

"GNU Image Manipulation Program"!!!!) We've used it a bit ourselves, and we can say
it's one of the first real "killer apps" we've seen on the Linux platform!!! And
now someone's done a port for Windows so all you Wintel fans can see how good it
is!!! But not quite yet, because it's in an early stage ATM!! But since it's a
free prog like the original Gimp, it'll means that less people will pirate
Photoshop, so it's quite a good thing of course!!!!!

          wierd!!! Just as we were ready to give up on this lot, they suddenly 
          turn not to be dead after all!!!! Almost one month after the debut issue 
          appeared, and 3 weeks after both the websites disappeared, the original 
          website goes up again!! (Tues 25th Aug!!) No explanation is given though, 
          as the page put up at the old Gamerush site URL is exactly the same 
          as when it went down!!! We dunno if this is some sort of subtle "Zen" 
          publicity policy or what!!! But before this latest development, over 
          the past couple of weeks we're trying to find out what on Earth happened 
          to "Scotland the Raw" since the two websites went down on Thu 8 Aug... 
          (See <a href="5.html#163"> issue 5</A>...) 
          <P>
We used loadsa websearches, we trawled the news using <B>Deja-News</B>-
nothing!!!! Nada!!! Zippo!!! Seems no-one's heard of "Scotland the Raw"
ezine on the Internet!!! (Except readers of this mag of course!!!!) The
last thing we did before we jacked it in was to send an enquiry into a
couple of Scottish-related newsgroups asking if anyone had heard of it,
and knew what had happened to it!!! We sent a message to <a href="news://soc.culture.scottish/">news://soc.culture.scottish/</a>
on Monday night, and got one of our friends who has access to local Scottish
newsgroups sent a message of their own on Tuesday.... Then suddenly,
on Tuesday the Gamerush webpage reappeared!!!! (Hmmmmm... What a strange
coincidence!!!) At the time of writing though, the <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a>
address is still non-existant!!!
<P>
Perhaps the re-appearance of the website, with it's contact email addr for
subscriptions to the zine, is their subtle way of gearing up for a second issue?!?!?

the site appears to have a bit of a strange idea as regards to web design, it's
actually quite good!! The articles and short and sharp and to the

writer/s appears to be completely cyncial about everything and are
pretty funny!!! (The editor also gives a really good email impersonation

disgusting pictures in an issue of MM, and they printed it!!! And they

example, they censored my reference to "rock music journalism"!!!!!!

Still the fact that this <B>Robin Bresnark</B> person, who was editing the letters
pages this week, chose to make small changes like that means that he obviously
was making an effort include my letter as he thought it was so bloody brillliant!!!

          6</A>...) Well, someone's been quick on the draw, and found a rather 
          sneaky way of using it!!!! You might remember Microsoft bought over 
          <B>Hotmail</B>, the free web-based email service... Well, you can send 
          web pages as mail using Hotmail!!! Yep, you guessed it, you can include 
          Javascript in the mail!!! So someone's done a mail which includes Javascript 
          dialog which makes like you've just logged out of Hotmail, and then 
          asks you for your Hotmail username and password and mails it to someone!!! 
          What's really sneaky is that as Hotmail is owned by MS, they're more 
          likely to be punting it to their Internet Explorer-using users, and 
          the "Spartan Horse" trick looks much more convincing in IE!!!!!

<B>Update (Fri 28 Aug)</B> - MS is going to get around this by getting Hotmail
to strip away Javascript from any web pages sent as email!!! What if it's a
"nice" Javascript program!?!? Seems a bit of stupid idea to me, as it's
hardly fixing the original "Spartan Horse" problem in the first place!!! MS
should really be making sure Javascript dialogs in IE look noticably
different from system dialogs so that no-one's fooled by them!!!<P></font>

Anyway, here are a few we tried at complete random!!!!<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Suffering is Hip</B>
<DD>The name almost really put us off this one!!! But the graphics are really
nice, and the writing isn't all barely readable "<B>Suck.com</B>" type stuff!!!
And the actual point of the site is to take the piddle out of "serious" art, so
that's pretty decent, although we wouldn't mind if they took the piddle a little
more, and not take themselves too seriously while they're at it!!!

<DT><B>The Bits</B>
<DD>This is an interesting one, as it's not trying to be painfully hip like a lot of
zines!!! One good feature is that in some sections, there's a form to add your
own stuff, a bit like Slashdot!!!

<DT><B>AKP Zine</B>
<DD>We really like this one!!! The site has a nice clean design, and more
importantly the articles are pretty good!!! If you're used to stuff like
the articles in <a href="../../saggie/default.html"><B>Maggie</B></A> diskmag, then you'll like this!!!

<DT><B>MOiRAzine</B>
<DD>When you enter this site, you get a Javascript dialog saying <I>"If you like
blowjobs, click on OK"</I>!!! The heading on the top of the next page is
<I>"Slutty is good"</I>!!!! So you might get the idea that this is not a
very subtle site!!!! And you'd be right!!! But it's quite funny!!!
<P>
Actually, it doesn't really look like a zine at all, more a sort of wierd
homepage!!!

That's all for the moment, as I'm flippin' tired!!! (Editing a brilliant zine
like this is hard work!!!!!
