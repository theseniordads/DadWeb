Old Fart's letter to Melody Maker!</FONT>
<P> Here's a <a href="../text/mm.txt">letter</A> I emailed to <B>Melody Maker</B> 
  on 13th Aug 1998. And they actually printed it in their 29th Aug issue!!! If 
  you follow the links here, you can see the piccies I was complaining about!!!! 
  Which is just as well, because you probably wouldn't understand this letter 
  otherwise!!!
<P> If you just came here by way of a search, you can find out more in <a href="../7.html#219">issue 
  7</a> of the ezine <B><a href="../../default.html">Senior Citizen</A></B>!!!

Dear Melody Maker....<P>

Bllleeeuurrghaaarrgghh!!!<P>

That was me just reading Melody Maker Aug 15 1998!!!<font size=-3><a href="#1">(1)</A></font> I had a very nice
lunch at the cafe down the road, and I've now just lost it due
to the insensitivity of your photo editors in assembling the most unnerving 
collection of "images" ever seen in a single publication!!!!! Including:
<UL>
  <LI>A <a href="../graphics/mm/front.jpg">reject from "Grange Hill"</A> on the front 
    cover!! 
  <LI>The <a href="../graphics/mm/manics.jpg">Manic Street Preachers</A> apparently 
    suffering from hay fever!! 
  <LI><a href="../graphics/mm/ewan.jpg">Ewan MacGregor</A> in a "70's" style- presumably 
    a Martian 70's style!!!<font size=-3><a href="#2">(2)</A></font> 
  <LI><a href="../graphics/mm/gene.jpg">Martin Rossiter</A> of Gene wearing earmuffs 
    after an argument with a lawnmower!!!<font size=-3><a href="#3">(3)</A></font> 
  <LI>Some incredibly smug looking Jazz Club type, who turns out to be <a href="../graphics/mm/wells.jpg">Michael 
    Wells</A>, formerly of Technohead and "I Wanna Be A Hippy" fame!!! (Nurse!!) 
  <LI><a href="../graphics/mm/gorky.jpg">Gorky's Zygotic Minci</A>, who need a trip 
    to the chiropodists as well as the hairdressers!!! 
  <LI><a href="../graphics/mm/flick.jpg">Flick</A>- the pic even had a space for a 
    "Holly's Crap Snap" logo to go on it!!! 
  <LI><a href="../graphics/mm/flc.jpg">Huey from Fun Lovin' Criminals</A>- just add 
    a sweatband and he's Mark Knopfler!!! 
  <LI><a href="../graphics/mm/puressence.jpg">Puressence</A>- when kids are taking 
    the piddle out of you in your own flippin' photo, you know something's wrong!!!! 
  <LI>And finally, how on earth did you get such a bad piccy <font size=-3><a href="#3">(4)</A></font> 
    of the <a href="../graphics/mm/beachboys.jpg">Beach Boys</A>!??! They look like 
    a flippin' 70s folk band- there's even a dog in the pic!!! 
</UL>
Was this a complex ruse to make the <a href="../graphics/mm/mansun.jpg">Mansun</A> 
photos look reasonable by comparision!??! If so, it's succeeded!!! But only by 
turning MM into the rock music journalism equivalent <font size=-3><a href="#4">(5)</A></font> 
of "Saving Private Ryan"!!!!!! 
<P>
Like the Kylie song, I'm "Shocked"!!!!!!!! <font size=-3><a href="#3">(3)</A></font>
<P>
Yours blah blah,
<P>
Old Fart!
