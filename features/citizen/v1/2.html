<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, some of you managed to come here for the first issue anyway!!! But
there's this "when is it going to be done as a mailing list"??!?! stuff!!!
Look, I'm flipping doing that so shut up!!! Anyway, I've set up a little
mailing list for discussion and stuff. You can log onto here, but just in
case some thing funny happens, here's the hard way to do it!!!!<P>
Go to <a href="http://www.coollist.com/">http://www.coollist.com/</a> , and goto the little bitty which says
subscribe to a mailing list, put "seniornetzien" in the list name, and
then put your email addr in the email field (well, er, I think so!!!)!!!<P>
Anyway, my main acheievment this week is to totally abstract the story
and issue format to hell, and stuck all the stories in a database, so
I just need to run a couple of proggies and hey presto- fully formed
issues of Senior Citizen!!! Now I just need to plug in a new look...

fought a lawsuit on behalf of some MS full-time employees who didn't
get treated as proper full-timers because they were put on the temp
staff roll!! So MS is apparently trying to make their policy the law,
so they can't get done!!!! Is this the first time MS have tried to
"embrace and extend" the law?!?!

it's got the following keywords in it's meta tags: "sex, teen, virgin,

Interestingly enough, they're looking for beta-testers!!! Unfortunately,
the application form requires you to specify what US state you come
from!!! So I put my full addr with country and so on, and selected
Wyoming for the state!!! So anyone from outside the US, I recommend you
select "Wyoming" as a sort of code-word for "If it's US only, why the feck
did you put the form on the Internet?!?!?!"

on about a film based on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!!! Yes, I know
there's already one form the 70s, but that was rubbish! :) Apparently it's
from Warners, and the original rumours spoke of a live version with
Michael Jackson in it!!! But apparently it's actually going to be a big
cartoon. In the link below, apparently the film will be a bit "darker"
than the older film, which probably means that it's a bit more like the
original Roald Dahl book!!

compute, and you can hear the minuet on a MIDI player!! In fact, if
you're reading this on the webpage, then you've probably heard one of

hearing about "portals"!!!! If you don't know already (Don't worry,
they'll be going on about it over here in the UK pretty soon!!!), portals
are basically web-guides with big front pages with lots of subject intrest
headings, which have lots of little sub-headings and so on... The best
example I can think of is the front page of <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</a>
Well, now that virtually every search engine and ISP in the US has a
"portal", companies are now trying to pretend that they're not at all the
same as everyone else!!! And first up is Lycos, who now deny that they're
a portal- apparently the magic word is now "hub"!!!!

(A gun, you dirty so-and-so!!!!) in church as long as they've got a
concealed-weapons permit!!! Wow!!! The congregations must get pretty rowdy
in Kentucky!!! Not all the church dudes are happy though. One said: "Jesus
would puke." !!!!!!!!!! (Look, I don't make these quotes up you know!!!!)
