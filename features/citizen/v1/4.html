<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, that was a very nice little trek around the islands of Scotland!!!
And now, I'm back!!! And... What!!! You notice the difference?!?!? Yep,
I've been tinkering around with the look a little, so don't be surprised
if you see a few more changes!!!! (If you're reading this in email, you'd
better come to the website or else!!!!)<P>
Now that the number of articles has broke the 100 mark, I've also added an
archive of all the articles featured!!! Great thing database programming,
isn't it!?!?<P>
BTW I'm wondering if I should change the title slightly, as some people
might have never heard of the <a href="../../../default.html"><B>Senior Dads</B></A>,
and so might be confused by the title "<B>Senior Citizen</B>"!!! Colostomy Bag
has suggested I might change the title to "<B>Senior Netzien</B>". What do you
think!??!

breaking down or Wormwood hitting the Earth type nonsense, it's our old friend,
the Millenium Bug!!! They're fearing all the computers and stuff stopping and
society breaking down and all the other survivalist cliches!!! "I look at
it as Judgment Day," one of the dudes rather predictably says... (How come
you never hear of survivalists who are Buddhists or into some other
religion?!?! I mean a survivalist that talked like Yoda- now that would

        <DD><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, a week after 
          they were supposed to have originally released it (See <a href="3.html#59"> 
          issue 3</A>...) , the first issue of the Scottish "Private Eye" style 
          ezine is out!!!! It's in email form, as the <a href="http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/">http://www.scotlandtheraw.com/</a> 
          website isn't up yet ATM, and the Gamerush address (See below) just 
          gives a pointer to a subscribe address to the email-delivered zine (Well, 
          at least it was- the actual pages appear to have disappeared Thurs 8 
          Aug!!!) 
          <P>
Anyway, the "Late transmition to allow the competition to exhaust themselves !"
excuse for it being one week late was apparently in reference to a
concerted attack on by some hackers!!!! Maybe the hackers read the
Sunday times interview!!!
<P>
Anyway, despite the claim on the Gamerush page that "Contrary to the press we
have received, this publication is supposed to be an entertaining look at
Scotland, not scandalous", Scotland the Raw starts off very much like a
Private Eye style mag!!! One of the people involved is apparently a paid-up
member of the Labour party, and the editor is quoted in the Sunday Times
interview as not really supporting independence for Scotland, so maybe this
explains why the scandal stuff appears to be mostly about Labours main
rivals in Scotland, the independence-supporting SNP!!!! Mind you, the
"top" story about selection of SNP candidates isn't quite as juicy as
the Eye stories about selection in the Labour camp- in fact, the whole
thing appears incredibly waffly!!! Hardly the "designed to be easily
digested titbits of salacious rumour which can be read on a coffee break"
business we were promised in the Sunday Times interview!!! OK, I'm used
to extremely compact ezines like Need to Know (<a href="http://www.ntk.net/">http://www.ntk.net/</a> ),
but I thought e-zine items were supposed to be short!!! (eg this is
the longest article I've ever written for Senior Citizen!!!)
          <P> Even, wierder, just when it seems to be chugging along like one of those funny 
            mags you used to get at Poll Tax demonstrations, then... "Gaming"!!!! 
            Huh!?!? Private Eye didn't have a computer games section!!!! What 
            we get is a report from the E3!!!! (Yep, a bit late, isn't it!!! (See 
            <a href="0.html#"> issue 0</A>...) ) It's subtitled "Cutting Through 
            the Hype!", but you have to wonder about that, since the whole gaming 
            section is actually "provided by <a href="http://www.gamerush.com">http://www.gamerush.com</a> 
            part of Reality X Interactive"!!! Who?!?!? Yes, it's from the same 
            company who do Scotland the Raw!!! No hype there I guess!!!!! 
          <P>
Anyway, it was just as boring as you
might imagine: so and so was on display at this stall yawn ZzzzZzzz...
Why do all reports from games exhibitions sound incredibly boring?!?!
Slightly more interesting was the mention of Scottish gaming firms,
which you don't usually hear of in the gaming press. Given that this is
supposed to be some sort of "Scottish" maggy, it would be pretty
interesting to hear a bit more about Scottish games firms!!!!!
<P>
After that another bizzare switch- this time to "Social Scotland", with
what is apparently a "review" of T in the Park (A bit more up-to-date
than the E3!!!!)!!!! I say "apparently", because the first 3 of the 6
paras are taken up with a rant about events in the hospitality tent,
which develops into what appears to be yet another slag off of the
SNP!!!! The next para says something about some "gig ban", and then
the last 2 (very short) paras are about the actual bloody concerts!!!!
I think it says a lot that the "reviewer" apparently really liked
Robbie Williams, Prodigy, The Seahorses, Catatonia, Super Furry Animals,
and Spiritualized- but couldn't say very much about it!!!!
<P>
In general, I think Scotland the Raw is pretty interesting for a first
issue!!! I think they could perhaps be a bit more even in style, instead
of jumping from Private Eye to The Edge to The List in quick
succession!!! (And get rid of those Gamesrush castoffs!! it's pretty
obvious!!!) The writing is pretty good, but could be a bit less waffly (Go read Wired News
or Need to Know!!!), the reviews could actually *review* the bloody things,
and there are pretty obvious political biases- either be bit more
even-handed, or just be honest about them!!! In general, I think they
have good potential, and with a bit of work, could be quite decent!!!!
<P>

If that doesn't work, why not try emailing them direct and asking for a
subscription to the zine? And tell them to fix the web page while they're
at it!!!!

"I've dodged your kick and hit you back" and so on!!! Then they both landed

cracked in record time by loads of people, you'd
think all this encryption business was pretty
insecure!!! And you'd be right!!!! But one software
company has decided to rip off all the old spy
techniques of coding their messages using "manual
hardware" means- in this case, the old "one-time-pad"
stuff, where everytime the message is envcrypted
differently according to a page in a "pad", which is
only used once, then destroyed!!! Only problem is...
How do you do that in a software form and make *that*
secure?!?! You'd have to transmit the "pad" to someone
so that they can receive your messages, so if someone
intercepts that, then bang goes your security!!! The software dudes
are currently using normal key
encryption to transmit the "pads", so that can be
broken!!!! To be really secure, you'd probably have
to keep the last "page" of the current "pad" in
order to encrypt the transmission of the next pad!!!!!

By ALLAN CALDWELL

Evening Times Thu 6 Aug 1998 front page.

The world's richest man has threatened to
pull the plug on hundreds of Scottish jobs.

Microsoft boss Bill Gates is furious over
raids on an East Kibride company that have
cost his computer firm millions of pounds.
    The American giants have slapped a
£500,000 "fine" on printing firm
Thomson Litho after the theft of 115,000
authenticity certificates for Microsoft
products.
    Thomson executives were so worried that
deputy chairman Gary Thomson flew to America
to plead with Microsoft - their biggest
client - not to withdraw their contract.
    But Gates said: "This is no bluff, we're
ready to pull the plug and Scotland will
suffer."
    Thomson plants in East Kilbride employ
more than 500 people. They have now been
hit twice by thieves.
    The first raid, last November, saw three
armed men burst into the factory - tie up
guards - and escape with a van full of CDs.
    The most recent raid saw authenticity
certificates stolen. These can turn pirate
copies into legitimate-looking products.

    RAIDS

Company hosses and police believe the raids
are the work of insiders.
  Gary Thomson said today: "The only people
I can trust in here are those who were on
holiday at the time of the last raid.
  "We want the stolen certificates back,
and to find the internal mole." Gary, who
jetted off to Washington to plead his firm's
case at a Microsoft board meeting, added: "We
were that close to losing our biggest client.
As a printing business we never realised just
how vulnerable we were to these hi-tech
criminals.
  "We convinced Microsoft that, as a firm,
we've wakened up to the threat facing us.

    BATTLE

"We have taken measures to ensure our security
matches that expected of us by the world's
leading computer software firm."
    The threat to Thomson's workers is just
the tip of the iceberg. More than 75,000 jobs
are involved in Scotland's Silicon Valley.
    Microsoft, whose Windows software is used
in 80 per cent of the world's desktops, has
admitted it's fighting a losing battle against
a computer mafia.
    The firm reckons it will lose £250m
through software pirates - a large proportion
of which will come from Scotland.
    And the crisis could jeopardise Scotland's
standing as a leading software centre - and
hinder hopes of further of inward investment.</PRE></div></TD></TR></font></TABLE>
