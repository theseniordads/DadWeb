When we first did our fabby-dabby w3sitey output on tha megamighty inphonet-pipeweb way back in the 1990s, we were pushing the boundries what could be acheived with HTML and gubbins!!!!! This was before CSS reared it's head, and we had to rely on the dreaded FONT tag to make our text look pretty!!!!! Well, prettier than black text on a white background, but you kno wot we mean!!!!!

At the time, the state of the art NetW3b NetBrowsey-wowsey was Netscape Navigator!!!!! So we did our w3bsitey to take advantage of that! At the time there weren't any browser standards, so the peeps wot did the browser often made up HTML tags of their own!!! One such tag in Netscape was the BLINK tag, which made things enclosed in the tags blink on and off!!!! And we used it a few times in our site!!!

Of course, the tag was only really fashionable for a short time, as it got overused, and people found it really annoying and distracting!!!!!!! It deliberately got left out of any W3 Standards documents for HTML, and w3Browseys have long ceased to recognise the BLINK tag....

**UNTIL NOW!!!!!!!!** When re-started in the website in 2015, we sought to recreate the blinks!!!! We did this originally using a jQuery plugin called "Modern Blink"!!!!!! But, [as you know](/updates/bye-jquery.html), we got rid of jQuery on this site, and anyway that plugin didn't bloddy work!!!!! Luckily, with advances in browsahtek, CSS can make things blink on and off, and they can applied to any HTML tag, including those that are no longer supported, like the BLINK tag!!!!!!!

So we're glad that we kept all the BLINK tags from our original website- we just applied our blink style to them, and now there blinking again- like a blinking blinker!!!!!!!!
