Hay!!!!! We've added to new demos to our [Demos](../demos/) Section!!!!!!!!!!!

The first is our ground-braking [MONO-MENTAL](../demos/monomental.html), the very first ever multiscreen demoe using the hi-res mode of tha Atari ST!!!!! Don't worry though, you won't need a hi-res monitor this time around to see it, as you can run it in an emulator on your laptop!!!!!

We've also added THE ULTIMATE FAKE DEMO, but you'll have to [read the description](../demos/fake.html) to find out why it's so ultimate!!!!!

That's all the old Atari demoes covered now, so we've added in the remaining chunes to the [Music](../music/) Section!!!! But there will be another addition coming soon to the Demos Section!!!! Can you guess what it is??!?!?!
