                            <p>Well, the story of how we came to do our amazing first demo is <a
                                    href="{{ "/demos/atuck.html#Story" | relative_url }}">very well documented </a>, but it doesn't tell
                                you how we first came together!!! </p>
                            <p>Originally, when we were teenagers, I ( <strong><a href="{{ "/crew/index#Old_Fart" | relative_url }}">Old
                                        Fart </a></strong>!!!!) became friends with <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/crew/index#Doddering_git" | relative_url }}">Doddering Git </a></strong>. We both had
                                Atari STs, and Doddering Git was really into the ST <strong><a
                                        href="http://www.fujiscene.home.ml.org">Demo scene </a></strong>, and was
                                showing me all these really great demos like the Onion Demo by Delta Boys and Dark
                                Side of the Inner Circle by The Lost Carebears!!! We thought <em>"Wouldn't it be
                                    great if we could do demoes like that?!?!? Yes!!!! Hey, let's try and make one
                                    of our own!!!!" </em></p>
                            <p>And even we were suprised at how good our demo was!!! So we sent it off to <strong>ST
                                    Floormat </strong>who were doing a feature on demos, and asked them what they
                                thought of it!!! Unfortunately, they <a href="{{ "/demos/floormat.html#Story" | relative_url }}">ripped
                                    us off </a>, and it really disillousouned us!!!! </p>
                            <p>Luckily we got back into demo coding once Atari brought out the <strong>Faclon
                                </strong>, and we each got one!!!! We developed a couple of really kick-ass demo
                                tricks which we later used in <strong><a href="{{ "/demos/atuck.html" | relative_url }}">Anal Tuck
                                    </a></strong>and <strong><a href="{{ "/demos/colonic.html" | relative_url }}">Colonic Irrigation
                                    </a></strong>. At this time,we got friendly with <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/crew/index#Dame_Vera_Lynn" | relative_url }}">Dame Vera Lynn </a></strong>, who had been
                                in a real-life demo crew before, and was trying to fit his ample musical talents
                                into <strong>sound tracker modules </strong>!!!! </p>
                            <p>We then went to the demo party <strong>Fried Place To Be 4 </strong>in 1995, and at
                                that party we decided to go for it, and make and release our first ever demo,
                                <strong><a href="{{ "/demos/atuck.html" | relative_url }}">Anal Tuck </a></strong>!!! And it got quite a
                                response!!!! </p>
                            <p>Shortly after we released our second demo, we decided to do a website (ie this
                                one!!!!)!! We needed help with the website GFX, so the Dame introduced us to
                                <sd_member who="Jackson Pollock">, the guy who was the artist in the demo crew the
                                    Dame was in, before they were both chucked out because of <a

                            </p>
                            <p>His job on the initial 2 page SD website was so impressive, we asked him to join the
                                crew!!! And he did!!!!!! And just before we released our amazing <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/demos/airdirt.html" | relative_url }}">Air Dirt Demo </a></strong>, we met an Amiga

                                who was really amazed by our demos, and wanted to code demos like that on the

                            <p>So that's how we came to be!!! </p>

                                some people didn't really understand that!!!! So we decided to change the names to

                            <p>The <strong>Air Demo </strong>is a demo we planned to release after <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/demos/colonic.html" | relative_url }}">Colonic Irrigation </a></strong>. We'd done
                                fire and water for our first two demos, so we decided to do air and earth for the
                                next two, starting with the <strong>Air demo </strong>! At the time, we had got
                                friendly with a crew called <strong>IPIR </strong>, and we were swapping tips and
                                source and stuff. Then, while we were finishing the Air demo, IPIR released a demo
                                at the NASA96 show with effects that looked very similar to our early Air demo
                                effects!!!! </p>
                            <p>We feared the worst,quickly cancelled the Air demo, and worked on a completely new
                                demo which was to become the <strong><a href="{{ "/demos/airdirt.html" | relative_url }}">Air Dirt demo
                                    </a></strong>, and stopped talking to IPIR!!! In fact, when we released
                                <strong>Air Dirt </strong>not long afterwards, we accused IPIR of ripping our code
                                in the README!!! </p>
                            <p>As it turned out, we were wrong- sorry IPIR!!! In fact, IPIR were just inspired by
                                some of our demos, and coded their own versions!!! </p>
                            <p>The <strong>Air demo </strong>remains unfinished, but if there's enough demand, and
                                we have enough time, we might possibly finish it... </p>

                            <p>Er, well, it really used to be simple!!!! It used to be that you could call our demos
                                " <strong>Atari </strong>" demos, but in the past few years things hav got reely
                                complex!!! First, Atari merged with an HD company called <strong>JTS </strong>, and
                                were called "JTS Atari", and then the rights to the name were sold to makers of the
                                <strong>Transformers </strong>, who are <strong>Hasbro </strong>!!! That's confusing
                                enough, but there's also an Atari ST emulator for the PC called <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/demos/pc.html" | relative_url }}">Pacifist </a></strong>, which can run some of our
                                demos really well!!!! So it's anyone's guess now!!!! Basically all the above are
                                words for the platform formerly known as <strong>Atari </strong>!!!! </p>

                            <p>Well, that's not really strictly true!!! We've done a <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/java/scribble/" | relative_url }}">Java drawing thingy </a></strong>!!!
                                And some of our Atari demos work fine on the PC emulator <strong><a
                                        href="{{ "/demos/pc.html" | relative_url }}">Pacifist </a></strong>, so they're also PC demos as
                                well!!! So there!!! </p>
                            <p>Anyway, the reason is that we started out on the Atari platform, and we like it
                                because it's really easy to program!! Also, it's really fashionable as well!!! Well,
                                how many T-shirts do you see with the Microsoft logo on it in a hip 'n' trendy
                                nightclub?!?!?!&nbsp; We think it's a really undervalued platform, and with our

                                Atari great again!!!! Well, I think it's a good enough reason anyway!!!!! </p>
                            <p>Actually, we are also wanting to spread some of our audiovisual magic to other
                                platforms as well, but we haven't got round to it yet!!! For a start, this PC demo
                                coding lark looks a bit complex!!! (But then, PC fans can see our <a

                                </strong>effect!!&nbsp; Actually we quite like the ol' Miggy hardware, and can see a

                                        <p>These are the first guys we heard of, and they claim to be older than
                                            us!!! Nevertheless, their NASA96 demo was obviously influenced by the
                                            sort of things we were doing at the time!!!! They're pretty good guys
                                            from Sweden- thanks for forgiving us when we accused you of ripping our

                                            demo for the Orneta 97 party!!! They've recently released two demos
                                            called " <strong>Senior Rats </strong>" and " <strong>Senior Fucks Out
                                            </strong>"!!!! We've only seen the second of those two demos, but it
                                            seems pretty obvious that there's a bit of rivalry from Rasero Team!!!
                                            Why, we don't know!!!! But we responded by getting the <strong>Dame
                                            </strong>to do a chip music tune in their style called " <strong>Rasero

                                            two small demos. One of them, called the <strong>Reject Demo </strong>,
                                            was pretty good but didn't have any music in it, so we patched the demo
